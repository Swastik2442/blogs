Today we have the story of a Discord User known by the username ***Vortex*** from the Discord Server of Glock Gaming

## The Story
### The Rise

It was the time when the Minecraft Server of Glock Gaming had just started, and we had a wave of many users coming into the server for playing Minecraft. Among these many people, there was this guy named Vortex. Initially tho, he was a great player at Minecraft (probably still is) and a *very humble* guy. He although used to troll others but it was purely for fun. 

It was our Server's peak time when the Minecraft Server had started. Lot of cool people, lot of bad people along with a lot of server activity. As we know, the great time never lasts long and that's what happened, the two main Managers of our Server began a sort of Cold War. People supporting one guy, kept listening to that guy's commands and people supporting the other guy, kept listening his. Vortex was also the supporter of one of them. The guy he supported had a greater influence on the Server, which sadly led to leaving of a lot of users due to the fight. Vortex probably left in this leave wave.

> **NOTE**: The story above although seems short but happens in about 6 months of real time.

### The Fall

Now, in probably 2021 end, Vortex has been to many other servers & also according to him, also led a server to 13K Members.This time, Vortex is the *wannabe cool* sort of guy, thinks of him as the best guy of the world, things he can do cannot be done by others.

In the meantime, our Server has also been through some very tough time, like when some hacker pruned 13K+ members of our Server. The server already being very inactive due to the bad times, we tried starting the Minecraft Server again and bring the OG members back. Our dear Vortex was also one of them, and he eventually got the Staff role ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°) 

One day, I don't know due to which reason, he starts questioning Discord Server Bot Setup. This guy starts saying that Loki had setup the server, which is why it is so bad, he could have just done it better. According to him, this was mere criticism, but due to the fact that he was targeting me intentionally when most of the Server Setup was done by the two Main Managers as I mentioned above, it was nothing more than harrasment or trolling. Then, he starts trolling the Minecraft server setup too, that it is laggy because of the staff, he could have done it better. *sike*

Now comes the real bad stuff, this guy starts giving false warns for fun, which in turn makes other staff also give fake warns. I think I myself got 6 warns that day for no reason at all. ðŸ˜‚

Then, comes yesterday, this guy already in his ego, starts trolling me in VC that I read in 7th class (which is actually not true) and Glock did a mistake making a Kid the Admin as he could not handle the server where he (Vortex) could have done it better. Due to too much trolling & harrassment, this guy eventually got a Ban.

### The Aftermath

Usually when a User gets banned from a Community, he/she should not try to enter it again using unlawful reasons; but here, our guy Vortex, thanks to his Alts, enters the Server again, to diss the Server ðŸ¤£

Imagine sending messages like these~

## How It Should Have Been

As this guy brags himself of being a *Critic*, I must mention some definition for you :)

According to [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/critic), 

**Critic** means ***a person who judges, evaluates, or criticizes***

This being said, a Critic does not intentionally mocks some other person, while saying that it was Criticism or Suggestion.

If by any chance, our guy would have been a real Critic, he would have suggested things like try these settings or use this bot instead of this, use this plugin or setup it like this. 

It's a great difference in being a Critic & in being a Troller.

### With this, we can learn that being a Critic is good but not being a Troller Critic. The job of a Critic is to help rectify mistakes in a system and not intentionally mock/troll others for the system.
